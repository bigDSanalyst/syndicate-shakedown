"""Continuous priority anchoring for the syndicate vault (v2, CLI-based).

In a no-custody protocol, provable priority IS the enforcement layer
(Agreement section 7.4). Each run writes a canonical-JSON manifest of git
HEAD, tree hash, and sha256 of every ledger file; appends an entry to
ledger/anchors/log.jsonl (an append-only hash chain over entry cores);
and submits the manifest to OpenTimestamps calendars through the
official ots command-line client.

v2 replaced the python-opentimestamps library API with the ots CLI
after release 0.4.5 broke imports and serialization silently. Status
flow: unsubmitted -> (ots stamp) -> pending -> (ots upgrade + Bitcoin
attestation) -> confirmed.

The ots info output is the machine interface: the File sha256 hash line
proves which bytes a stamp covers; a BitcoinBlockHeaderAttestation line
marks Bitcoin confirmation. verify works on a bare file export (no git,
no Bitcoin node); the ots CLI is needed only for .ots digest checks.

Commands: run, upgrade, verify, milestone --tag T --message M.

Exit codes:
    0  done - every anchor's state was established
    1  needs a human: an anchor unsubmitted past the stale window, or a broken
       chain on `verify`
    2  transient: the OpenTimestamps calendars could not be reached, so some
       anchors' state is unknown. NOT the same as unconfirmed, which is a
       statement about Bitcoin rather than about the network.

    else's tree. This was reverted once and recreated by a single dispatch 43
    minutes later, so the refusal belongs in the tool rather than in discipline.
