"""Report what the template changed since this syndicate was generated from it.

The guard symmetry this completes: the smoke suite proves the mold works, and
nothing until now proved an instance still matches the mold it came from. Row 37
fired three times in the session that closed it, and remediating design-partner
repos by hand is the chore that kills adoption.

Git-native, no version numbers: syndicate.yaml records the upstream commit this
repo's lineage starts at, and the diff between that commit and upstream HEAD IS
the remediation checklist.

WHAT COUNTS AS DRIFT
--------------------
Instances inherit machinery and rules, never narrative. FINDINGS.md, ROADMAP.md
and docs/ are the template's own scar tissue and priorities; they are stripped at
activation and changes to them are not this repo's business. Everything else the
template ships is machinery, so the filter is a denylist rather than an allowlist
on purpose: a new upstream directory should show up as drift the first time it
appears, and being told about a file that turns out not to matter is a smaller
failure than never being told about one that does.

The rule that decides the hard cases: THE STRIP LIST STRIPS INHERITANCE, NOT
IDENTITY. A repo's record organs - ledger/ (what is proven), agreements/ (who is
bound), audits/ (what was found wrong) - are the syndicate's own receipts, and
the protocol exists to preserve them. An audit written about THIS repo is this
repo's history even though it reads like narrative; the mold's findings are
someone else's. Hence audits/ is a root directory beside the other record
organs rather than a docs/ subfolder: docs/ is inherited and stripped, so
instance-authored history kept there would be one prompt away from deletion.

Commands
--------
    drift_check.py check     what changed upstream since this repo's lineage commit
    drift_check.py record    write the current upstream head into syndicate.yaml

Exit codes (a green run must never mean "I could not look"):
    0  in sync
    1  needs a human: a mold, no lineage recorded, or a commit upstream disowns
    2  transient: the network or the rate limiter, try later
    3  drift found - actionable, not an error
