# Beyond Scalar Flexibility: From Eligible AI Workloads to Dependable Load Relief

## Abstract

> Grid studies often represent data-center flexibility as a fixed percentage of load, although no
> public production trace has shown how much eligible load persists across event durations or co-
> moves across clusters. We reconstruct 4,439 hourly power observations from a 185-day trace of
> 155,410 GPUs and derive a workload-semantic flexibility envelope. The fleet's time-averaged
> Monte Carlo median facility demand is 55.8 MW, while immediate eligible curtailment averages
> 3.55 MW after retaining allocated-GPU idle power: 12.1% of workload power and 6.35% of median
> facility power. Under full realization of that eligibility, 95%-available relief falls from 2.51
> MW for one hour to 2.32 MW for four hours and 1.95 MW for 24 hours; a common realizable fraction
> q scales every value exactly by q. A mean-calibrated scalar overstates these quantities by 17%,
> 25%, and 47%, while a scalar tail-calibrated at four hours understates the one-hour product by
> 6% and overstates the 24-hour product by 17%; the share that reproduces the surface varies by a
> factor of 1.6 across durations and reliability levels. Aggregating 13 clusters raises four-hour
> firmness from 0.38 to 0.66, but cross-cluster covariance limits the gain. The production
> scheduler exposes almost no additional delay-based capacity: newly deferrable arrivals average
> 0.008 MW and have zero 95%-available capacity. These results replace an assumed flexibility
> percentage with duration, reliability, portfolio, and realizability terms that can be written
> into interconnection and demand-response contracts.
